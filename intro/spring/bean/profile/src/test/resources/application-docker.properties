# This configuration file will be used when the profile "docker" is active.
# As this is activated by profile, it will be applied on top of and override the
# default application.properties file

# Besides using H2, in some cases we might still want to test against a real DB,
# possibly of the same kind used in production, although that would be much slower
# than using an embedded DB like H2.
# But it poses the problem of installing and starting/stopping the DB on the developer machines...
# How to do it? Docker...

# Note: not specifying "spring.datasource.url" here, as it dynamically depends on TestContainer.
#       So it will be set at runtime directly in the tests.
